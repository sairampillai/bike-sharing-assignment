# Bike Sharing Assignment
- Problem statement: Build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- Business goal: Understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. Find out:
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- Bike demand has increased from 2018 to 2019
- Temperature and season highly effect the demand. Specifically people preferred high temperature and low humidity for biking.
- Spring season, Light snow/rain, and Heavy snow/rain had a highly negative impact on demand.
